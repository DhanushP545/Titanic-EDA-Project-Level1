# Titanic EDA Project Level 1

This project is a **basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of the Titanic dataset using **Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib**. It's aimed at building strong foundations in data analysis and preparing for machine learning.

##  What‚Äôs Covered So Far

###  Phase 1: Data Loading & Inspection
- Loaded the Titanic dataset
- Understood column types and structure
- Basic info, summary stats, and `.head()` preview

###  Phase 2: Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values in `age`, `embarked`, and `cabin`
- Dropped unnecessary columns like `ticket`, `fare`, and `cabin`
- Converted `survived` and `pclass` to categorical types

###  Phase 3: Exploratory Analysis
- Grouped and compared survival by class, gender, and port
- Examined value counts and unique entries
- Discussed usefulness of features like `sibsp` and `parch`

###  Phase 4: Visualization
- Bar plots of survival by gender and class
- Histograms for age distribution
- Box plots to analyze age variation across classes
- Combined plots using `hue` for deeper insights

##  Tools & Libraries Used
- Python (Google Colab)
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

---

## Dataset
- Titanic dataset is loaded from Seaborn's built-in datasets  
  *(No need to download separately)*

---

## Upcoming (To Be Added)
- Phase 5: Outlier detection & treatment
- Feature engineering (e.g. family size, titles, age bins)
- Correlation analysis
- Machine learning (Logistic Regression)

---

## üìÅ How to Run
- Open the [Google Colab Notebook](<https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1c06QQP6tVSHpf44LjLVuWqhOPQ3sFW44?usp=share_link>)
- Run cells top to bottom. All required libraries are pre-installed in Colab.
